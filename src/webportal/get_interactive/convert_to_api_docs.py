INPUT FORMAT: The input contains step-by-step agent actions with captured network requests in this format:
- Agent output sections showing what the agent was doing
- Route sections showing captured API calls with basic information

OUTPUT FORMAT: Convert this into structured interactive elements with the following format:
{example_format}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

There are 2 types of requests:
- GET requests
- POST requests

You will directly give an example using one of the two tools:
get_request or post_request.

1. **REMOVE USELESS ROUTES**: Filter out routes that are not useful for API documentation:
   - Static asset requests (CSS, JS, images)
   - Duplicate or redundant requests  
   - Internal tracking/analytics calls
   - One-time setup requests
   - Requests that don't provide meaningful functionality

2. **DO NOT GENERALIZE**:
   - Keep all specific values as they are.
   - Example: "numpy/numpy" should remain "numpy/numpy".
   - Do not replace values with variables like `^owner` or `^repo_name`.

3. **INFER MISSING INFORMATION**:
   - Add logical `type` (Button, Dropdown, Link, etc.)
   - Add descriptive `visual_element` based on context
   - Add clear `trigger` description based on agent actions
   - Add meaningful `effect` explaining what the API call accomplishes
   - Add `viewport_effect` describing UI changes

4. **STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZE**:
   - Group related functionality together
   - Use clear, descriptive names for interactive elements
   - Ensure each element is self-contained and reusable
   - You can add any additional information that you think is relevant to the API call

5. **MAINTAIN TECHNICAL ACCURACY**:
   - Keep all actual API endpoints, methods, and parameters intact
   - Preserve JSON structure in arguments
   - Don't modify GraphQL query hashes
   - Keep response format descriptions accurate

INPUT TO CONVERT:
{content}

Generate clean, structured API documentation following the format above. Focus on creating reusable, specific interactive elements that would be useful for an LLM to understand GitHub's API patterns."""
