Main objective: I would like for a specific webpage (like for instance "https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues") to create a markdown page so that it would be much easier for an agent to use the website. The markdown file would contain:
* the static content of the page (like the html)
* a list of all all the possible requests that can be done 

This list would be given as a list of tools so that our agent can use the webpage very efficiently.

Here is an example:
```interactive_element_issue_hover
type: Hover trigger
visual_element: Issue links
trigger: Mouseover on issue link
request: GET https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/$issue_number/hovercard
arguments: {
 "subject": "repository:$repo_id",
 "current_path": "/$repo_name/issues"
}
effect: Displays a popup card to view issue details
returns: HTML with issue title, description preview, and labels
viewport_effect: none
```
```interactive_element_author_filter
type: Button/Dropdown
visual_element: "Author" button on top of the issues list, in the filter bar
trigger: Click
request: GET https://github.com/_graphql
arguments: {
 "query":"76143934e91fc5d431ea7b83f63b08b9",
 "variables":{"capabilities":["CAN_BE_AUTHOR"],"first":30,"loginNames":null,"name":"numpy","owner":"numpy","query":""}
}
effect: Loads author suggestions for filtering
returns: JSON with suggested authors including bots and users
viewport_effect: none
```
```interactive_element_label_filter
type: Button/Dropdown
visual_element: "Labels" button on top of the issues list, in the filter bar
trigger: Click
request: GET https://github.com/_graphql
arguments: {
 "query":"b480cbd1d6d3f7ba4a98229e88acf3fd",
 "variables":{"count":100,"labelNames":"","owner":"numpy","repo":"numpy","shouldQueryByNames":false}
}
effect: Loads all available labels for filtering issues
returns: JSON with label data including id, color, name, nameHTML, description, and URL for each label
viewport_effect: Opens dropdown showing all repository labels with color coding and descriptions
```
``Ã¬nteractive_element_closed_button
type: Button/Toggle
visual_element: "Closed" button in the issues filter bar
trigger: Click
request: GET https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues
arguments: {
 "q": "is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed"
}
effect: Filters issues to show only closed issues
returns: HTML page with filtered list of closed issues
viewport_effect: Reloads the issues list showing only closed issues, updates URL parameters
```
```
interactive_element_sort_oldest
type: Button/Dropdown
visual_element: Sort dropdown button with "Oldest" option in the issues list header
trigger: Click on sort dropdown and select "Oldest"
request: GET https://github.com/_graphql
arguments: {
 "query":"22d008b451590c967cc8d672452db3f9",
 "variables":{"includeReactions":false,"name":"numpy","owner":"numpy","query":"is:issue state:closed sort:created-asc repo:numpy/numpy","skip":0}
}
effect: Sorts the issues list by creation date in ascending order (oldest first)
returns: JSON with paginated issues data sorted by oldest creation date first
viewport_effect: Updates the issues list display to show issues sorted chronologically from oldest to newest
```

What I want to do is to use playwright to automatically do this task. TO identify all of the interactive elements, then interact with them automatically, in order to do that, I want to have either the possibility to use the playwright API or to use the browser to interact with the page manually. Then, I want to capture the requests and then create the markdown file with the possible requests.
